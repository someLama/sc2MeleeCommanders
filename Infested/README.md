## Building changes
Mobile structures (Command centers, Barracks, Factories, Amalgamate and Infestor Compound, Contamination launchers) propagate creep in a large area. Supply depots propagate creep in a small area.
The Contamination launcher is not implemented yet. It will be used for the global ability of the Infested Horde: Contaminating a building, which incapacitate it and make it produce broodling unit the contamination end.
The contamination can go on forever, it is a channel ability that can be casted from a launcher to any near building. It can also by casted by a corruptor, provided there is a contamination launcher off cooldown. (like a ghost that would cast a nuke from an Academy)
