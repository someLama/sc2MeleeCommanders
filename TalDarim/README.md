# The Tal'Darim Cult

Alarak is the Highlord of the Forged.

## Gateway Units

*Supplicants* are the basic fighter of the Forged. They are an expandable version of the Adept of classic melee. They can be sacrificed to restore empower an *Ascendant* or *Ascended Archon*. They cost 2 out of 5 warp charges of Warp Gates.

*Stalkers* works exactly like in classic melee games, but with dark skin. They cost 2 out of 5 warp charges of Warp Gates.

*Blood hunter* also are exactly dark templars, but even edgier. They cost 3 out of 5 warp charges of Warp Gates.

*Ascendants* are the main spellcasters. They cost 3 out of 5 warp charges of Warp Gates. They have the following abilities :

- Crimson storm, which strikes in a huge cone, dealing damage to allies and enemies alike over 4 seconds for 80 total damages (like a storm). This storm needs one second of pre-channeling, during which anyone can see where the storm will hit. The *Ascendant* must keep channeling during the storm, or it is interrupted. The energy is not consumed if the ability is canceled during the pre-channel phase.
- Disintegrate (Need to be researched at the *Templar archives*)
- Sacrifice, which restores all their energy at the cost of a *Supplicant* life. Can be upgraded to also permanently increase their spell damages by 25% and shields by 20. This can only be stacked 4 times.
- Ascend, which requires to have the 4 stacks of Power Overwhelming. This morph the caster into an *Ascended Archon*, which have the same abilities, but with shield instead of energy (Storm and Disintegrate cost 75 shield, Sacrifice give back 150 shield)


## Robotic Units

*Scouts* are good at intercepting other air units. They can harass enemy workers or a small number of light units, but cannot stand against heavy firepower.

*Oracles* are detectors, they can reveal the weakness of up to two units at once, increasing the damage dealt to them by 15% (30% once upgraded). They can put in statis an enemy unit (need to research at the *Fleet beacon*).

*Warp prisms* work like in classic melee games.

*Vanguards* deals a lot of splash damages with a low attack speed.

*Wrathwalkers* attack at long range, can attack while moving, but are vulnerable to anti-air attacks. They can be upgraded to fire instant laser instead of a burst, which mitigate overkill when several Wrathwalkers are side by side.


The Tal'Darim can warp a *Mothership* at any Nexus once they have a *Fleet Beacon*. The Mothership can deal heavy splash damage in a line to enemy ground units and recall with close allies toward any allied Nexus.

## Other changes

Protoss shield upgrade now increases shield regeneration and decreases the waiting time before the shield starts the regenerate after taking damages. The resistance of the shield is always 0.

Producing through Warp Gate is now slower overall than producing through Gateway. Warp Gate now consumes charges to warp units, high-tech units require more charges. They have 5 charge maximum, Supplicants and Stalker requires 2, Ascendants and Blood Hunters requires 3 charges.
