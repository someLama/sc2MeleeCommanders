Melee Commanders is an extension for custom melee games.

In this mod, instead of selecting a race, you choose a faction among Daelaam, Taldarim, Dominion, Miraâ€™s Marauders, The Swarm, and The Infested.

These 6 factions are heavily inspired by their coop equivalents but balanced for player versus player short and fun games.

There is fewer macro mechanics (no more queen inject, chrono, mule), and the leftover macro is easier to handle (autocast on unit production, select all larvae hotkey for the swarm, etc.).

Mass air composition is no longer a threat to mass ground. You can have only one capital ship at a time (like the Mothership in classic melee). Capital ships are strong against ground but weak against other air fighters. This should encourage players to max out on ground army, and have a capital ship and an air force for harassment and/or anti capital ship.
The mod is still under development, which means there is a few bug left, and a few features not implemented yet. But I think this is already playable enough for fun game.
I hope you will enjoy it! If you have any feedback, please let me know!

Warning :
Currently, the AI does not know how to play with the 6 custom factions.


Unit list, changelog and quick guide for each faction :

- Daelaam tribe (Yet to come)
- [Tal'Darim cult](TalDarim/)
- [Dominion empire](Dominion/)
- Mira's Pirates (Yet to come)
- [Blades' Brood](Swarm/)
- Infested Horde (Yet to come)

The following is shared by all factions. Almost all faction get :

- A ground ranged unit, which is overall good against anything (marine, dragoon, hydra, etc.)
- A ground main spellcaster, with some abilty to increase it's energy regeneration (templar, ascendent, infestor, defiler, ghost, spectre)
- A flying secondary spellcaster, often it is also the flying detector of this faction (oracle, coatl, raven, overseer, etc.)
- An air fighter, fast and good against other air unit, can harass, but not fight big ground army (scout, wraith, phoenix, etc.)
- A capital ship, you can have only one on the field at a time (like the mothership), it is really strong against ground unit, but weak against air fighters.
- Static defenses cost 1 supply each.

There is less +1 upgrades now : +1 attacks and +1 armor affect all unit for each faction. Zerg factions also get +1 regen on creep (for ground units and building). Protoss factions get +1 shield regen, which also decrease the time before the regeneration start (but the shield is not affected by armor bonus).

Pride & Greed harvesting mode :

Workers are twice as big, durable and expensive. they take 30 secondes to build, bring 20 minerals per trip (30 if rich), but have an harvest time twice as long. Extractors, Assimilators and Refineries cost 100 minerals instead of 75, two workers are enought to saturate it (4.5 seconds of harvest time), and give 10 vespene per trip (15 if rich).

This game mode focus on a nomad play style where you can harvest from field without having to build a full base. It mitigates efficiency loss from long distance mining (as the mining time take a bigger part in the squedule of a worker). This also make AOE less effective for worker harrass.

'Pride & Greed' will be the name of a futur mod, which will use MeleeCommanders as a base.


In future updates, you will be able to use global abilities across the map, which will require special buildings, like the coop medivacs of Tychus or the bombers of Mira. These abilities will be :
- Precision recall for the Daelaam (a recall as big as a sentry forcefield).
- Nexus / Pylon overcharge for the Tal'Darim
- Psy emitor for the Dominion (you launch the emitor anywhere on the map, after a few seconds it attracts a hybrid hostile to anyone in sight)
- Bombers for Mira (like in coop)
- Drop pods for the Swarm
- Infestation for the Infested (Work like Stukov coop instestation, but channeled through a corruptor, also stun the building like classic overseer infestation).
To avoid easy worker damage (for example with bombers), this ability will not work around enemy townhalls. (Nexii, Command centers, and Hatcheries will have the "Orbital Defense" ability which blocks global abilities around them).
