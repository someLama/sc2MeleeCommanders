## Melee Commanders is an extension for custom melee games.

In this mod, instead of selecting a race, you choose a faction among Daelaam, Taldarim, Dominion, Miraâ€™s Marauders, The Swarm, and The Infested.

These 6 factions are heavily inspired by their coop equivalents but balanced for player versus player short and fun games.

There is fewer macro mechanics (no more queen inject, chrono, mule), and the leftover macro is easier to handle (autocast on unit production and spells, select all production facility hotkey, etc.).

Mass air composition is no longer a threat to mass ground. You can have only one capital ship at a time (like the Mothership in classic melee). Capital ships are strong against ground but weak against other air fighters. This should encourage players to max out on ground army, and have a capital ship and an air force for harassment and/or anti capital ship.
Spellcaster should also be less dominant (for example storm damage are spread over 6 seconds instead of 4, their is no sentry or viper, raven spells cost more energy, etc.)

The mod is still under development, which means there is a few bug left, and a few features not implemented yet. But it should be already playable enough for fun games.
I hope you will enjoy it! If you have any feedback, please let me know!

Warning :
Currently, the AI does not works yet !


## Quick guide for each faction :

- [Daelaam tribe](Daelaam/)
- [Tal'Darim cult](TalDarim/)
- [Dominion empire](Dominion/)
- [Mira's Pirates](Pirates/)
- [Blades' Brood](Swarm/)
- [Infested Horde](Infested/)

## The following is shared by all factions. Almost all faction get :

- A ground ranged unit, which is overall good against anything (marine, dragoon, hydra, etc.)
- A ground main spellcaster, with some abilty to increase it's energy regeneration (templar, ascendent, infestor, defiler, ghost, spectre)
- A flying secondary spellcaster, often it is also the flying detector of this faction (oracle, coatl, raven, overseer, etc.)
- An air fighter, fast and good against other air unit (especially capital ships), can harass, but not fight large ground army (scout, wraith, phoenix, etc.)
- A capital ship, you can have only one on the field at a time (like the mothership), has strong AEO ground damaging abilities, but weak air defenses.
- Static defenses cost 1 supply each and have 8 range instead of 7.

There is less +1 upgrades : +1 attacks and +1 armor affect all unit for each faction.
- Zerg factions also get +1 regen on creep (for ground units and building).
- Protoss factions get +1 shield regen, which also decrease the time before the regeneration start (but the shield do not get armor bonus).
- Terran factions get an upgrade to halve repair time and make it free.

## Pride & Greed harvesting mode :

Workers are twice as big, durable and expensive. they take 30 secondes to build, bring 20 minerals per trip (30 if rich), but have an harvest time twice as long. Extractors, Assimilators and Refineries cost 100 minerals instead of 75, two workers are enought to saturate it (4.5 seconds of harvest time), and give 10 vespene per trip (15 if rich).

This game mode focus on a nomad play style where you can harvest from field without having to build a full base. It mitigates efficiency loss from long distance mining (as the mining time take a bigger part in the squedule of a worker). This also make AOE less effective for worker harrass.

'Pride & Greed' will be the name of a futur mod, which will use MeleeCommanders as a base.


In future updates, you will be able to use global abilities across the map, which will require special buildings, like the coop medivacs of Tychus or the bombers of Mira. These abilities will be :
- Precision recall for the Daelaam (a recall as big as a sentry forcefield).
- Nexus / Pylon overcharge for the Tal'Darim
- Psy emitor launch for the Dominion (you launch the emitor anywhere on the map, after a few seconds it attracts a hybrid hostile to anyone in sight)
- Nightingale strike for Mira (blinding smoke in an area)
- Drop pods for the Swarm (can launch up to 8 slots of units, as much as the capacity of one transport overlord)
- Buuilding contamination for the Infested (Work like Stukov coop instestation, but channeled through a corruptor, also stun the building like classic overseer infestation).
To avoid easy worker damage, this abilities will not work around enemy townhalls. (Nexii, Command centers, and Hatcheries will have the "Orbital Defense" ability which blocks global abilities around them).
