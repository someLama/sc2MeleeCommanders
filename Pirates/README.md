# Mira's Pirates

Mira's does not goes on the battlefield herself, she can get up to 2 elite mercs on the battlefield among the 5 available.

*Galleons* are the primary production facility of the pirates. They can take flight, and can also connect to add-ons stolen to opponents. Reactor works as usual and Tech lab allow the Galleon to produces heavy units that would normally be available at Merc compound

## Units produced in galleons

*Marines* work as usual.

*Reapers* have the anti-structure grenade and can be upgraded to fly for 10 seconds.

*Widow Mines* work as usual and can be upgraded to burrow and reload faster.

*Spectre* are the main spellcasters. They have the following abilities :
- Fear (mono-target). 
- Cloak (requires reasearch)
- Cannibalize: Drains 50 life from a ground biological unit (Friendly or not) and regenerate 20 life and 50 energy over 10 seconds (requires reasearch)
- Nuke

## Units produced in merc compounds

*Hellions* use anti-light unit grenade and can morph into *Hellbats*. They benefit from Smart servo research.

*Vikings* are larger than usual. Landed vikings deal bonus damage to armored units. They benefit from Smart servo research and Vehicle afterburners research.

*Science Vessels* are detectors, they can cast EMP and defensive matrix.

*Hercules* benefit from Vehicle afterburners research.

## Joeyray’s bar
Biological units can go to the bar to be slowly healed. The bar can also be used to deploy and retire elite mercs, only two elite mercs can be deployed at the same time, among this five heroes :

*James Raynor* and is vulture is a fast, anti-light unit that can deploy timed spider mines

*James “Sirius” Sykes* and is warhound can deploy powerfull timed auto-turrets

*Rob “Cannonball” Boswell* can dash at enemies and stun them with its HERC suit.

*Lt. Layna Nikara* can heal any unit and deploy experimental temporal fields.

*Gabriel Tosh* is the leader of the specters. He can stun in AOE, use nukes and is invisible.


Any Galleon can be morphed into the capital ship of the pirates: The Sandokan.

## Buildings changes

Terran no longer has Orbital Command. Scan can be cast from Sensor tower instead (90 sec CD, cost 50/25).
Sensor tower only detects tremors in its detection range now, meaning it wont sense by hovering or flying unit, but will sense invisible ground units like ghosts and dark templars.

The Nightingale platform is not implemented yet. It will be used for the global ability of the Pirates: launching Nightingale that cast a blinding smoke at target location.
