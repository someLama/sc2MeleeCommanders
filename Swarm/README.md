#The Blades's Brood

The brood of the Queen of Blades: Sarah Kerrigan.

## Tier 1 units

*Zergling* works like in classic melee, except two zerglings can merge into a roach.

*Hydralisk* is weaker and cheaper than the classic melee hydralisks. They can morph into Lurker. 

## Tier 2 units (Lair required)

*Roach* is morphed from two zerglings merging. Roaches are bigger and tankier than their classic counterpart, but not big damage dealer. Their attack slow the move speed, and they can be upgraded to also slow the attack speed. Two Roaches can merge into an Ultralisk.

*Mutalisk* did not change much in this mod, except it deals lower damage to non-light units. You can also morph them into Devourer once you get the Greater Spire.

*Lurker* is less expensive, its attack is slower, has less range and deals less damages. Two lurker can merge into an impaler

*Defiler* is the main spellcaster. It can cast Dark Swarm, an area lasting 10 seconds where every ground units take damages reduced by 80% from ranged sources and by 50% by splash like psy-storm. Once upgraded, it can cast Plague, dealing non-lethal temporary damages to every units touched (temporary means the victim will recover after 20 seconds if they are not killed before). The Defiler can consume other units to regain energy, and can deep tunnel toward near creep.

*Overseers* are detectors, they can spawn changelin and infested nest. Infested nest generate creep, explode when ground unit steps on it, and generate broodling upon death. 

## Tier 3 units (Hive required)

*Impaler* can be upgraded to apply root on attacks.

*Devourer* is a specialized anti-air unit. It can reduce the armor of all units in a zone. It is morphed from a mutalisk.

*Ultralisk* have received a few buff: it can tower over smaller units (like aberration), and can get upgraded to get the Burrow Charge. It is morphed from two Roaches merging together.

*The Leviathan* is the capital ship of the Blades' Brood. It is morphed out of a Hatch, Lair or Hive once you have the Greater spire.


## Buildings changes

The creep colony can propagate creep and spawn larvae (at a slow rate). It can be morphed into a spine or spore crawler. This building is meant as a replacement for the Queen. 

Hatchery, Lair and Hive spread creep in a larger area. They no longer create a small creep pool during building time.

Spine and spore crawlers also propagate creep. They now cost one supply. Creep colonies and spine crawlers have tremor sense.

The drop pod launcher is not implemented yet. It will be used for the global ability of the swarm: launching units from the sky. (You will have to load your units into the structure, and then select when you want to send them.

The nydus network works more like the broodwar nydus canal now: You can only spawn a worm where you already got creep, but the worm are cheaper.
