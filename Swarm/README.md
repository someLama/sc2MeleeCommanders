# The zerg Swarm

Sarah Kerrigan, known as the queen of blades, lead the Swarm.

- *Zergling* works like in classic melee, except two zerglings can merge into a roach.
- *Hydralisk* is weaker and cheaper than the classic melee hydralisks. They can morph into *Lurker*. Hydralisk are Tier 1 units (You don't need a *Lair*, just a *Spawning pool*, to build the *Hydralisk den*).
- *Roach* is morphed from two *zerglings* merging. *Roaches* are bigger and tankier than their classic counterpart, but not big damage dealer. Their attack slow the move speed, and they can be upgraded to also slow the attack speed. They are Tier 2 units (You need the *Lair* to make the *Roach warren*.). Two *Roaches* wan merge into an Ultralisk.
- *Mutalisk* did not change much in this mod, except it deal lower damage to non-light units. You can also morph them into *Devourer* once you get the *Greater Spire*.
