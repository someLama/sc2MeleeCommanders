# The terran Dominion

Arcturus Mengsk leads with an iron fist the terran empire. No sacrifice is too great for the humanity !

The workers of Arcturus are the *Operators*. They can harvest, build and repair like normal *SCV*, but they are also able to scavenge the armors and gears of your fallen troopers to equip them on other *marines*, they can also build and operate *Siege tanks* and *Thors*.
