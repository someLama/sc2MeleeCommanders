# The Terran Dominion

Arcturus Mengsk leads with an iron fist the Terran empire. No sacrifice is too great for humanity!

## Units

The workers of Arcturus are the *Operators*. They can harvest, build and repair like normal *SCV*, but they are also able to scavenge the armors and gears of your fallen heavy troopers to equip them on other *marines*, they can also build and operate *Siege tanks* and *Thors*. You can reduce the build time of your *operators* at the *armory*.

The basic infantry of the Dominion is composed of *Marines*, *Marauders* and *Firebats*. The *Firebats* have more health in this mod, and they can dash toward their target (upgrade required).

The *Ghosts* can Cloak (Research at *Ghost Academy*), Drain energy out of other units (Autocast against enemies), Snipe (Deals 50 damages to any target, 100 if it is biological), and Nuke. The energy drain can be upgraded to mute the target for a few seconds.

*Siege Tanks* and *Thors* are produced directly on the battlefield by your *Operators*, then they need a crew of *Operators* to function. (Both mechs units have the "Load all" buttons). They both benefits from Immortality Protocol (Research at the *Fusion core*). The Thor can use Barrage (Research at the *Armory*).

The *Wraiths* are the air fighters. They can cloak (Research at the *Tech lab*) and are good at intercepting other air units. They can harass enemy workers or a small number of light units, but cannot stand against heavy firepower. They can reduce their energy consumption for cloaking (Research at the *Fusion core*).

The *Medivacs* work as in classic melee overall, except they have only 100 energy max, but regenerate their energy almost twice as fast. They can be upgraded to heal two targets at the same time and to have a temporary speed boost.

The *Ravens* are cheaper (100/100) than in classic melee. It can only use Interference Matrix and Anti-armor Missile.

The *Norad IV* is the capital ship of the Empire, this heavy battlecruiser is similar to the Hyperion from Coop but weaker against air targets.

## Buildings changes

Terran no longer has Orbital Command. Scan can be cast from Sensor tower instead (90 sec CD, cost 75/25).

The Psy emitor launcher is not implemented yet. It will be used for the global ability of the Dominion: launching Psy emitors from orbit to attract a Hybrid. The Hybrid is hostile to everyone.
