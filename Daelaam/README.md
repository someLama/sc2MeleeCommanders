# The Daelaam Tribe

Artanis is the Hierarch of the Daelaam, the union of Khalai and Nerazim tribes.

## Gateway Units

*Zealots* are unchanged. A Warp gate need 2 charges to warp one of them. 
*Preservers* are low range tank units that can cast chronomancy (slow one enemy unit) in exchange of shield points. They can be upgraded to also apply chronomancy on their attacks, and get the ability to meditate, which boost their shield regeneration, allow them to slowly heal nearby biological units, and grant them tremor sense.
*Dragoon* are a bigger version of the stalker, they cost 3 supply in this mod and have the range upgrade at the robotic bay. A Warp gate need 3 charges to warp one of them. 

*Dark templar* are unchanged. A Warp gate need 3 charges to warp one of them.

*High templar* can cast Hallucination in addition to Storm and Feedback. Storm damages are dealt over 6 seconds instead of 4, total damages remain the same. Starting energy and energy regeneration can be upgraded at Templar Archives.
A Warp gate need 3 charges to warp one of them.

## Stargate units
*Phoenix* now have their regular attack and another anti-capital ship attack that cost energy. The lift can be upgraded to not disable the phoenix anymore.

*Coatls* are detectors, they can turn invisible and cast disruption web (similar to corsairs) 

*Warp prisms* work like in classic melee games.

*Reavers* are delivered by a shuttle from the stargate. The are closer to the broodwar Reaver than the LotV Reaver.

The *Gantrithor II* is the capital ship of the Daelaam tribe. It is similar to the Clolarion Carrier of Fenix, with a guardian shield spell that cost shield points.

## Other changes

Protoss shield upgrade now increases shield regeneration and decreases the waiting time before the shield starts the regenerate after taking damages. The resistance of the shield is always 0.

Producing through Warp Gate is now slower overall than producing through Gateway. Warp Gate now consumes charges to warp units, high-tech units require more charges. They have 5 charge maximum, Zealots and Preservers requires 2, Dragoon and Templars requires 3.
